- traveltime
- studytime
- failures
- schoolsup
- famsup
- paid
- activities
- nursery
- higher
- internet
- romantic
- famrel
- freetime
- goout
- Dalc
- Walc
- health
- absences
- G1 (First period grade)
- G2 (Second period grade)
- G3 (Final grade)

## Tasks

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**

   - Download the Student Performance dataset.
   - Load the dataset using Pandas or any other suitable library.
   - Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Data Splitting:**

   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

3. **Model Implementation with PyTorch:**

   - Implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model using PyTorch.
   - Design the architecture of the MLP model, including the number of input nodes, hidden layers, neurons per layer, and output nodes.
   - Experiment with different activation functions, dropout layers, and regularization techniques.

4. **Training the MLP Model:**

   - Train the MLP model using the training data.
   - Utilize techniques such as mini-batch gradient descent and backpropagation.
   - Monitor training progress by tracking metrics such as loss and accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation:**

   - Evaluate the performance of the trained MLP model using the testing data.
   - Calculate relevant evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

6. **Analysis and Interpretation:**
   - Analyze the results of the MLP model and interpret its predictions.
   - Identify factors that significantly influence student performance.
   - Discuss potential interventions or strategies for improving student performance.
